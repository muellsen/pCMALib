!!!!!!If used as part of libpcma, this Readme and all the connected files, except the CEC2005.f90 can be ignored.!!!!!!
This is the Readme to the Fortran Implementation of the CEC2005 Suite.
Implementaion mainly based on the Java Version of the CEC2005 Test Suite that can be found here:
http://web.mysites.ntu.edu.sg/epnsugan/PublicSite/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

For general information and more detailed explanation of the functions go here:
http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/EPNSugan/


The following Files should be included in this Testbench:

- CEC2005.F90				! the actual Test Functions. For inclusion in you project only
					! this file is needed.
- testCEC2005.F90			! Code to validate the Functions writen
- tests/ExampleCEC2005.F90		! Programm demonstrating how to use CEC2005 Fortran code
- makefile				! makefile to create the Example Programm
- make.inc				! Parameters that are changeable for the makefile
- /SupportData				! Folder containing all Supporting Materials for the Functions
					! see the Readme File in there for more info.
					! taken from the Java Code linked above
- /testData				! Data generated by the Matlab Version of the Code to validate
					! the Java Version. Also used in the testCEC2005 Functions.


Check out ExampleCEC2005.F90 to see how to use the Test Suit!

Detail Notes

- The Preprocessor Statements in the CEC2005 File are there, so that it can be easily used together with Fortran CMA-ES which
  it was implemented for. Just use Preprocessor and dont define __SP,__CMA and __DP and it should work fine (like in the makefile)
